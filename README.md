# tomaaato.xyz - Landing Site

[tomaaato.xyz](http://tomaaato.xyz/) is hosted on Heroku and deployed via this repo. (Meaning it's configured to be heroku-deployment ready).

Most built using React & Bootstrap, Express is also used for a little bit of back-end, and threejs for the geometric animation.

A custom build pipeline has been written, using babel to convert ES6 and JSX into node-friendly ES5, and browserify to bundle source code into one browser-ready script.
